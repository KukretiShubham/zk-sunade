## Features
- Optimized the code size to 17 KB from 26 KB.(Unoptimized)
- Minimal use of std library. Removed use of parse() method , instead used bytes to reduce size.
- Verifier is deployed on Arbitrum Stylus testnet at this address : 0x
- Proofs are working. We are demontrating it , by using tornado cash's code as a POC.
